Development of a website for opus lab, a training centre specialising in digital skills, based on a mock-up created by the Opus Lab UI/UX team:

Main features:
- Attractive homepage: the homepage is the first thing visitors see when they arrive on your site. It should be attractive, informative and make visitors want to know more about the training centre.
- Presentation of the training offer: a section dedicated to the presentation of the training offers proposed by the centre with detailed descriptions of the different programmes, testimonials from former students.
- Online registration: to facilitate the registration process, an online registration form has been set up. This will allow visitors to register easily and quickly for a course of their choice.
- Testimonials and success stories: testimonials from former students and their success stories after attending one of the courses to encourage other visitors to register.
- Social networks: Finally, you can add links to your social network accounts to allow visitors to follow you on different platforms. This can also strengthen your online presence and brand image.
